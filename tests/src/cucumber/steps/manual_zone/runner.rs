//! Single per-scenario drive loop for a
//! [`lb_zone_sdk::sequencer::ZoneSequencer`].
//!
//! The drive task owns the sequencer and polls
//! [`ZoneSequencer::next_event`] in a loop, invoking a [`Policy`] inline for
//! each event. Step bodies issue commands via the SDK's
//! [`SequencerClient`] (handed out from [`Runtime::client`]) — those route
//! through the SDK's internal request channel and get processed by the same
//! drive loop, so reactions land before the next event is observed.
//!
//! Because the policy runs on the same task as event handling, reactions
//! (e.g. orphan republish) happen before the event is forwarded to tests —
//! there is no window where an event was observed but the policy's reaction
//! hasn't been applied to the SDK's state.
