    And I start zone sequencer "SEQ_A" with indexer
    # Take the node down: the sequencer enters its reconnect loop, but its

    When I stop node "NODE_1"
    Then publishing zone message with data "while down" via sequencer "SEQ_A" fails while the node is down

      | NODE_1    | 1             | WALLET_1A   |              | SEQ_A, SEQ_B |
    When node "NODE_1" is at height 1 in 120 seconds
    And wallet "WALLET_1A" sends 30 notes of 1000 LGO to node "NODE_1" funding wallet as "FUNDING_TOPUP"
    And transaction "FUNDING_TOPUP" is included on node "NODE_1" in 180 seconds
    And I start zone sequencers:
      | alias | indexer | pending_submit_depth | passive_republish_orphans |
      | SEQ_A | true    | default              | true                      |
    And sequencer "SEQ_A" publishes the following zone messages:
      | alias | data                      |
      | MSG_1 | inscription before re-key |
    And sequencer "SEQ_A" submits zone config transaction:
      | config_name | posting_timeframe | posting_timeout | authorized_sequencers |
      | CONFIG_AB   | 2                 | 0               | SEQ_A, SEQ_B          |
    Then zone transaction "CONFIG_AB" is finalized in 180 seconds
    When I start zone sequencers:
      | alias | indexer | pending_submit_depth | passive_republish_orphans |
      | SEQ_B | false   | default              | true                      |
    And sequencer "SEQ_A" submits the following zone messages without waiting for inclusion:
      | alias | data                    |
      | MSG_2 | in flight during re-key |
    And sequencer "SEQ_B" submits zone config transaction:
      | config_name | posting_timeframe | posting_timeout | authorized_sequencers |
      | CONFIG_BA   | 2                 | 0               | SEQ_B, SEQ_A          |
    And sequencer "SEQ_B" submits the following zone messages without waiting for inclusion:
      | alias | data               |
      | MSG_3 | post re-key from B |
    And sequencer "SEQ_A" submits the following zone messages without waiting for inclusion:
      | alias | data               |
      | MSG_4 | post re-key from A |
    Then zone transaction "CONFIG_BA" is included in 180 seconds
    And the zone indexer returns all zone messages exactly once in any order in 600 seconds
    And I stop all nodes
