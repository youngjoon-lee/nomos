/// * Executor dispersal

/// * Replication WARNING: Order of internal protocols matters as the first one
///   will be polled first until return a `Poll::Pending`.
/// 1) Sampling is the crucial one as we have to be responsive for consensus.
/// 2) Dispersal so we do not bottleneck executors.
/// 3) Replication is the least important (and probably the least used), it is
///    also dependant of dispersal.
