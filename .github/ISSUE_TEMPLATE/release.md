Most of the template content is the same or very similar to what is in `release-candidate.md`. So any changes to this file should be reflected there where relevant, and viceversa.

# IMPORTANT

**READ THIS BEFORE STARTING WITH THE RELEASE**

* This checklist should only be used with a release candidate that has been thoroughly tested and can be "promoted" to be a release. No changes other than what is needed to release it are supposed to be committed from the commit of the last release candidate being released
* Progress on the checklist must be provided as comments to the issue.

---

## Branch Setup

- [ ] Edit the name of this issue to use the actual version being released
- [ ] Verify that the `HEAD` of the release branch `release/X.Y.Z` is the same commit that was released in the latest rc
- [ ] Post the link of the latest release candidate GH release and the previous release candidate checklist that we are promoting to a full release

## Testnet genesis (optional, only whenever a new testnet deployment - with a new genesis - is required)

- [ ] Update the inscription file at `deployment/ceremony/genesis/testnet/inscribe.yaml` by setting the `chain_id` field to `X.Y.Z` and the `genesis_time` field to be approximately 10 mins in the future, following the existing [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) datetime format. No need to change the `entropy_sources`
- [ ] Commit and push the changes
- [ ] Manually trigger the [ceremony workflow][ceremony-workflow] from the `HEAD` of the release branch specifying the `testnet` image tag and the right version number `X.Y.Z`
- [ ] Post the link to the workflow run to this issue for easier review
- [ ] Wait for the workflow run to complete. The workflow will push a new commit on the release branch overwriting the binary's embedded deployment settings (`nodes/node/binary/src/config/deployment/settings.yaml`) with the testnet settings.

## Release preparation

- [ ] Checkout and pull the release branch. If the previous section about genesis creation was followed, it should contain the bot generated commit updating the deployment settings as its `HEAD`
- [ ] Bump the Cargo workspace version to match the new release version `X.Y.Z`
- [ ] Re-generate the workspace `Cargo.lock` file with `cargo update -w`
- [ ] Verify the `Cargo.lock` is now up to date with `cargo update -w --locked`
- [ ] Verify the `HEAD` of the release branch has green CI ✅
- [ ] Commit the changes, and tag them with `X.Y.Z`
- [ ] Push the commit and the tag
- [ ] Manually trigger the [Logos Blockchain tools build workflow][build-logos-tools-docker-workflow] from the `X.Y.Z` tag on GitHub specifying the `testnet` image tag. Leave "Optional version tag" empty.
- [ ] Post the link to the workflow run to this issue for easier review
- [ ] Without waiting for the workflow to complete, move on to the next section

## Release publication

- [ ] Manually trigger the [bundling workflow][release-bundling-workflow] from the `X.Y.Z` tag on GitHub with the `release` input to prepare the GitHub release draft with the built binaries
- [ ] Post the link to the workflow run to this issue for easier review
- [ ] Without waiting for the workflow to complete, move on to the next section
- [ ] Address checklist of the generated GitHub release in [https://github.com/logos-blockchain/logos-blockchain/releases](https://github.com/logos-blockchain/logos-blockchain/releases)
- [ ] Publish release
- [ ] Post the link to the published release to this issue for easier review

## Release module

- [ ] Enter the [logos-blockchain-module] repository locally.
- [ ] Branch out from the latest `master` commit with a release branch named `release/X.Y.Z`. If this is not the first release candidate for this version, HARD reset the branch on top of `master` and force-push the new tip
- [ ] Bump the `logos-blockchain.url` input in the `flake.nix` file: `logos-blockchain.url = "github:logos-blockchain/logos-blockchain?ref=X.Y.Z";`
- [ ] Set the version to `X.Y.Z` inside the `metadata.json` file
- [ ] Re-generate the `flake.lock` file using the command `nix flake lock`
- [ ] Commit the changes and tag them with `X.Y.Z`
- [ ] Push the commit and the tag
- [ ] Enter the [logos-modules-release] repository locally. If you just cloned the repository, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- [ ] Branch out from the latest `master` commit with a release branch named `blockchain-module-X.Y.Z`
- [ ] Navigate to the `submodules/logos-blockchain-module` directory and checkout the `X.Y.Z` tag
- [ ] Commit the changes to the [logos-modules-release] repository
- [ ] Create a PR for the blockchain module version changes and merge it to the master
- [ ] Manually trigger the [logos-blockchain-module-workflow] workflow without the `Force build` option selected from the `main` branch
- [ ] Post the link to the workflow run to this issue for easier review
- [ ] Wait for the workflow to complete before moving on to the next step
- [ ] Manually trigger the [node-docker-build-workflow] from the `X.Y.Z` tag
- [ ] Post the link to the workflow run to this issue for easier review
- [ ] Wait for the workflow to complete before moving on to the next section

## Testnet deployment

### Existing state cleanup (optional, only whenever a new genesis has been created in the genesis step)

- [ ] Checkout and hard reset the `testnet` branch to point to the latest commit of the current release branch
- [ ] Symlink the environment file to the repo root with `ln -sf deployment/.env.testnet .env.testnet`
- [ ] Create a new symlink `compose.static.yml` -> `compose.setup.yml` with `ln -sf compose.setup.yml compose.static.yml`
- [ ] Commit and push to `testnet` branch to trigger the cleanup
- [ ] Wait around 1 minute for the previous deployment to be cleaned. Visit the [Testnet web UI][testnet-web-ui] and make sure it's in setup mode.

### Released version deployment

- [ ] Verify the Logos Blockchain tools Docker image was properly built and pushed to the [GitHub container registry][logos-tools-image-container-registry]
- [ ] Wait for the new Docker image to be built after the release is published. It must have the `X.Y.Z` tag.
- [ ] Checkout `testnet` branch again and change the `compose.static.yml` symlink to now point to `deployment/compose.run.yml` with `ln -sf deployment/compose.run.yml compose.static.yml`. If this release included previous state cleanup, the new symlink should replace the previous `deployment/compose.setup.yml`, otherwise this should be a no-op.
- [ ] Update `deployment/.env.testnet` file to contain `NODE_IMAGE_LABEL=X.Y.Z` set to version being released
- [ ] Commit and push the changes to trigger environment re-deployment
- [ ] Wait around 1 minute for deployment to be updated. Environment is now live.
- [ ] If needed, at any time you can download fleet nodes' configs and logs from [https://testnet.blockchain.logos.co/internal/node-data/](https://testnet.blockchain.logos.co/internal/node-data/)
- [ ] Go back to the [GitHub Release][github-release-section] section and finalize the release

# Post-Release

- [ ] Update the release checklist template (this file and also `release-candidate.md`) or the GitHub release template with anything that was missing or that was fixed during the release process
